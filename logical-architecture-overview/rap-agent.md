# RAP Agent

The purpose of the RAP Agent is to acquire files from local file storage or Amazon S3 and ingest them into the RAP application. The Agent is installed on local Windows machines at client sites for the security of the client. Since the Agent handles all file ingestion operations at the client site, West Monroe does not need to access the client's machine directly.
