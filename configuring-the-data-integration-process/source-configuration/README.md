# Sources

The fields in the Source Configuration vary based on the selected Data Refresh, Connection, and Initiation Types. This guide covers all types and provides the step-by-step instructions needed to configure a Source.

## Sources Screen

On the Sources screen, users can see all previously created Sources, as well as search, edit, and filter them. By default, only Active Sources are listed. Users can change this by toggling the **Active Only** toggle. Note that only Active Sources are processed.
