# Pre-Deployment Steps

In order to deploy the RAP infrastructure via CloudFormation, several steps must be completed prior to running the each script. 

This section assumes that the AWS management environment has already been set up, and **that you are trying to add an additional environment.** If you have not set up the AWS environment, please see [Pre-Management + Increment Script](pre-management-+-increment-script.md).

1. **Login** to AWS Management Console
2. **Copy** the _Increment script_ to the S3 bucket you created before
3. You are now ready to run the Management + Increment script. **Continue** to [Cloudformation Script Deployment Steps](../cloudformation-script-deployment-steps.md)
