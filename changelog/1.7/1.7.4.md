### Added Warning if User Attempts to Delete Remaining Data on a Key Source

* **Impact:** When attempting to delete the remaining inputs on a Key Source, the user will be warned that by deleting the data, other Sources with Validation or Enrichment rules that reference the Key Source will malfunction.
* **Risks:** Low

###  Added Warning if User Changes the Tracking Column of a Source

* **JIRA ID:** DEV-242
* **Problem:** After changing the key\_columns, date\_column, or range\_column field of a Key, Timestamp, or Sequence Source, respectively, the user would attempt to ingest new data into the Source without first re-staging the existing data and find that their Source would have issues tracking changes in data. 
* **Impact:** The user will now be warned and prompted to re-stage existing Source data if they change the tracking column field of a Source.
* **Risks:** Low
