## The Data Flow

![The RAP Data Flow and corresponding storage locations](../../.gitbook/assets/rap-data-flow.png)

As seen in the above data flow diagram, RAP intakes raw data and outputs an organized data warehouse. The Logical Data Flow consists of eight steps: Ingest, Parse, CDC, Enrich, Refresh, Re-Calculate, Output, and Post-Process. The Data Storage Flow consists of four main structures: Raw Data, Data Lake, Data Hub, and Data Warehouse. Though not shown in the diagram, each step in each flow consists of generated and configuration meta data to aid the user in process management and configurations respectively.
