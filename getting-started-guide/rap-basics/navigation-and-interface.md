### Sources

The [Sources](../../configuring-the-data-integration-process/source-configuration/) Screen controls loading data from external systems into RAP, assesses quality via Validation Rules, and transforms data using Enrichment Rules. Additionally, it contains the Inputs tab to track the progress of individual file processing and enable restart of any failed or mis-configured processing tasks. Lastly, it contains the Data Viewer tab, allowing users to view and query the data for this Source stored within the Data Hub.

### Process

The Process screen shows the progress and outcome of all execution tasks through the platform, including sub-processes contained within the four standard processing steps of Input, Staging, Validation and Enrichment and Output.

### Outputs

The [Outputs](../../configuring-the-data-integration-process/output-configuration/) screen controls loading data from the Data Hub to the Data Warehouse layers. Source-target mapping, logs, and other output details can be viewed here, as well as historical outputs.

### Connections

The [Connections ](../../configuring-the-data-integration-process/connections-configuration.md)screen controls the connections to the External Source Systems and Data Warehouses. Connections can be used for both Sources and Outputs.

### Validation and Enrichment Templates

The [Validation and Enrichment Templates](../../configuring-the-data-integration-process/validation-and-enrichment-rule-templates.md) screen shows all of the available re-usable templates for creating similar Validation Rules and Enrichment Rules to multiple Sources.

### Source Dashboard

The Source Dashboard screen provides an over-time view of the outcome of each sources end-to-end processing.
