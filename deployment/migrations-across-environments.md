# Environment Migration Process

For RAP projects, configurators will be working with two different environments in order to keep test data and production data separate. the Environment migration process is the process of copying the state of one RAP environment to another so that an identically-configured environments can be created in a timely manner

### New RAP Implementations

TODO - you have one environment that will become PROD eventually, use it as your DEV

TODO - when you need to stand up a new DEV, go through steps in Code Deployment section, then go to next section for steps to migrate code PROD -&gt; DEV

### Existing RAP Implementations

TODO - document export / import steps from DEV to PROD

TODO - note that import / export done on source name, why those need to be in sync \(prevent duplicates\)
