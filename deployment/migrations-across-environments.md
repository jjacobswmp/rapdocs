# Environment Migration Process

TODO - write intro

### New RAP Implementations

TODO - you have one environment that will become PROD eventually, use it as your DEV

TODO - when you need to stand up a new DEV, go through steps in Code Deployment section, then go to next section for steps to migrate code PROD -&gt; DEV

### Existing RAP Implementations

TODO - document export / import steps from DEV to PROD

TODO - note that import / export done on source name, why those need to be in sync \(prevent duplicates\)
