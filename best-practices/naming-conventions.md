# Naming Conventions

A consistent naming convention for source names and enrichment names can make the difference between an easily maintainable solution and one that is difficult to understand.  This section suggests a naming convention that project teams can leverage when starting a new RAP implementation.

### Source Names

TODO - multi-tenant source naming

### Validation and Enrichment Names

TODO - effective template naming

### Output Names

TODO - system name in output name

### File Names and Bucket Usage

TODO - loopback naming, file naming, S3 bucket usage
