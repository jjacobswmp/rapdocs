# Configuration Metadata Model

All data residing on the PostgreSQL database is organized into 3 main schemas.

### Configuration Metadata \(stage\)

TODO: Document main tables, add an ERD, discuss concept of source\_id vs input\_id vs landing\_id \(add diagram for this as well\)

### Working Data \(work\)

TODO: Document main types of tables \(data work tables, lookup tables\) and naming conventions

### Processed Data \(data\)

TODO: Document ts vs. key tables and naming conventions
