# S3

Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service in the AWS ecosystem. RAP uses S3 for storing and accessing physical input files for staging, archiving physical input files for storage, and for deployments â€“ in conjunction with the CodeDeploy service. Locating a physical file that is stored in RAP is an example of a support case that requires accessing S3. As stated before, files can be in their staging path either in the EC2 instance \(**`/input/`** \) or in S3. However, files always archive in S3.

The naming convention for the RAP storage buckets are as follows:

```text
s3-<region>-<environment>-<rap_type>-<number>-<owner>
```

For example, if the name were `s3-ue2-d-etl-landing-001-wmp`, then this would be the landing folder for the Dev orchestrator for the West Monroe Partners account. The following are important buckets for processing:

* **`S3-<region>-<environment>-etl-landing-<number>-<owner>`**: Input files stage to this bucket if the staging path is set to this file path. `Staging_path` parameter is defaulted to this.
* **`S3-<region>-<environment>-etl-output-<number>-<owner>`**: Provided bucket for outputting files from RAP.
* **`S3-<region>-<environment>-input-archive -<number>-<owner>`**: Input files archive to this bucket based on retention policies.
* **`S3-<region>-<environment>-output-archive-<number>-<owner>`**: Output files archive to this bucket based on retention policies.

**Note:** All other buckets either create ad-hoc or are for RAP deployment processes. Refrain from editing or removing files from them.

A simple query to run in Postgres to find the current location of an input file:

```sql
SELECT file_path FROM stage.input WHERE input_id = <your_input_id>
```
